# Development Roadmap & Tasks
## AI-Powered CV Optimization Platform

### 1. Project Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive development roadmap, sprint planning, and task breakdown for the AI-Powered CV Optimization Platform. The project is divided into 4 phases with clear milestones and deliverables.

### 1.1 Task Completion Workflow
- **Unique Task IDs**: Each task has a unique identifier (e.g., `BE-001`, `FE-015`, `AI-003`)
- **Completion Process**: When implementing, agents should mark tasks as complete by replacing `[ ]` with `<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[x]</span>`
- **Progress Tracking**: Use the task ID and completion marker to maintain clear progress visibility
- **Verification**: Ensure all dependencies are resolved before marking tasks complete
